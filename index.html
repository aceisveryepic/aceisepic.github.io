            i'm using this site as a hub for everything about me, kinda like a blog but less in the moment, there should be blogs posted in the future but its
            super early right now. <br> there are links at the bottom of the page that can link you to other pages here, external links, references, blah blah blah
            just what ever else i want to upload and spend time coding and implementing. sorry its really basic and bare bones right now. i know it kinda sucks but
            its okay. I think I'm gonna replace the logo at the top with a cool real logo instead of just lame text. <br/> <br/>
